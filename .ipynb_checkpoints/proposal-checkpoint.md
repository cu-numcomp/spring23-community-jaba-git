### Notes/concerns/risks

Please comment on any anomalies or known risks to following this
project, if you were unable to answer any questions above, or
otherwise have concerns about the appropriateness of the software.  If
the project requires a contributor license agreement or other
procedural steps, please explain here.  "None at this time" is
acceptable for this question.

I do not know about an automated test suite, and I do not know about continuous integration. I was also unsure about how to answer the typical commit size question. It appeared to me that most commits were a single file being changed, which is why I answered 1 file, but I don't know if this is what you're looking for.
